# User Churn Prediction using Waze dataset

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting user churn in the Waze app, measuring the number of users who uninstall or stop using the app. The primary goal is to develop a machine learning (ML) model that can accurately predict user churn. This README provides a summary of the project, its objectives, and key findings.

## Project Goals

The main aim is to create a reliable ML model that predicts user churn for the Waze app. This predictive model can help identify users at risk of leaving, allowing for targeted efforts to retain them.

## Key Components

1. **Random Forest Classifier:**

    - A Random Forest Classifier is used for building the predictive model, trained on historical data to understand patterns associated with user churn.

2. **Grid Search Cross-Validation:**

    - Hyperparameter tuning is done using Grid Search Cross-Validation to optimize the Random Forest model's performance.

3. **Scoring Metrics:**
    - The model's performance is assessed using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for a comprehensive evaluation.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preparation:**

    - Raw data on user interactions with the Waze app is collected and processed to create a suitable dataset for model training.

2. **Random Forest Model Training:**

    - A Random Forest Classifier is trained on the prepared dataset, capable of capturing complex data relationships.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**

    - Grid Search Cross-Validation fine-tunes the model's hyperparameters for improved accuracy.

4. **Scoring and Evaluation:**
    - The model's performance is evaluated using key metrics, offering insights into its strengths and potential areas for improvement.

## Key Insights

-   Accuracy and other scoring metrics are vital for assessing the model's reliability in predicting user churn.
-   Results from Grid Search Cross-Validation provide insights into the optimal hyperparameters for the Random Forest model.
-   Continuous monitoring and improvement are essential to adapt the model to changing user behaviors and app usage patterns.

## Future Work

-   Further analysis and feature engineering could enhance the model's predictive capabilities.
-   Consideration of additional data sources or features may provide a more comprehensive understanding of user behavior.
-   Deployment of the model in a real-world setting and continuous monitoring for updates and improvements.
